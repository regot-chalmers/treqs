# High level user stories for TReqs

## User stories for XFT member

 [userstory id=US1a] As a member of a XFT, I want to share new knowledge we learnt about existing requirements during a sprint so that our implementation and the requirements on system level are consistent. 
 [userstory id=US1b] As a member of a XFT, I want to be aware of requirements changes that affect my team so that we can pro-actively address dependencies. 
 [userstory id=US1c] As a member of a XFT, I want to update system requirements efficiently, without too much overhead, and ideally integrated in the tools I use in my daily work. 
 [userstory id=US1d] As a member of a XFT, I want to maintain traces between requirements, change sets, and tests in a way that is integrated with my natural workflow and enables valuable feedback. 

[userstory id=US2]
As a system manager, I want to make sure that proposed updates to requirements are of good quality, do not conflict with each other, or with the product mission. 

[userstory id=US3]
As member of an experimenting team, I want to experiment with new requirements and features so that I can better assess their business value and cost. This must not affect existing requirements during the experiment or block the requirements database afterwards. 

[userstory id=US4]
As a test architect or system manager, I want to be aware of new requirements for the test infrastructure early on so that I can plan verification and validation pro-actively.
