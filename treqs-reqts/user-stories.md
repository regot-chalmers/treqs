# High level user stories for TReqs

## User stories for XFT member

US1: As a member of a XFT, I want to 
  a) share new knowledge we learnt about existing requirements during a sprint so that our implementation and the requirements on system level are consistent. 
  b) be aware of requirements changes that affect my team so that we can pro-actively address dependencies. 
  c) update system requirements efficiently, without too much overhead, and ideally integrated in the tools I use in my daily work. 
  d) maintain traces between requirements, change sets, and tests in a way that is integrated with my natural workflow and enables valuable feedback. 


US2: As a system manager, I want to make sure that proposed updates to requirements are of good quality, do not conflict with each other, or with the product mission. 

US3: As member of an experimenting team, I want to experiment with new requirements and features so that I can better assess their business value and cost. This must not affect existing requirements during the experiment or block the requirements database afterwards. 


US4: As a test architect or system manager, I want to be aware of new requirements for the test infrastructure early on so that I can plan verification and validation pro-actively.
